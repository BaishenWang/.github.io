In this Kali Linux, I experimented how to set up the static website, dynamic website
and ssh. I know about the web application architecture. Apache is the web server
that processes requests and serves web assets and content with HTTP. MYSQL is
the database that stores all information in. PHP is the programming language that
works with apache to help create dynamic web content. Apache is the important
software to people create website. Whatever you want to work on static website or
dynamic website, apache can complete mission easily.
