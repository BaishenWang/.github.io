### Project Overview
This project was a collaboration between me and my classmates in ICS 314 to create a website called Toaster Eats. The goal of this project was to create a functional and practical web application for UH students to share recipes. Users are able to add recipes, search for recipes, find ingredients, and find stores for the ingredients. The project spanned a little over a month and took a collaborative effort from Toaster Eats group members to produce a fully functional website.

### Contribution & Experience
I had many learning opportunities with this project and played a very active role in developing the website. Some of my key contributions are creating user page. During this journey, I learned how to effectively communicate with multiple team members on a collaborative coding project. Github is a Mavelopus tool that gives groups the ability to create and combine work in many different ways through branches and pull requests. These useful tools helped me contribute solutions to a large problem that we all tackled.
