### Project Overview
This project was a collaboration between me and my classmates in ICS 314 to create a website called Toaster Eats. The goal of this project was to create a functional and practical web application for UH students to share recipes. Users are able to add recipes, search for recipes, find ingredients, and find stores for the ingredients. The project spanned a little over a month and took a collaborative effort from Toaster Eats group members to produce a fully functional website.

### Contribution & Experience
Throughout this project, I had numerous chances to learn and actively participated in crafting the website. One of my significant contributions was the creation of the user page. Along the way, I gained valuable insights into effectively communicating with various team members in a collaborative coding environment. Github proved to be an invaluable tool, enabling groups to seamlessly create and merge work through branches and pull requests. Leveraging these tools, I was able to offer solutions to significant challenges we encountered collectively.
