Coding standard is the grammar in coding language that everyone program should be following. Some of these rules include syntax, code format, and many other things. By following these rules, it helps produce a polished code that can be easily read and interpreted by other programmers.
 
## Experience with ESLint
Embarking on the coding adventure with ESLint, I encountered a rollercoaster of experiences that shaped my perspective on this indispensable tool. Initially, grappling with ESLint was akin to navigating uncharted territory; the syntax, code formatting, and numerous rules presented a formidable challenge. The ever-present red warning lines, signaling deviations from ESLint's coding standards, became both a guide and a source of distraction.
One of the primary hurdles was the immediate disruption caused by these warning lines. They often pulled me away from the creative process of coding, compelling me to rectify errors in real-time. This interruption, though valuable for maintaining coding standards, underscored the delicate balance between adhering to rules and preserving the flow of creativity. This aspect became particularly crucial in time-sensitive scenarios, such as athletic software engineering practices where efficiency is paramount.
Despite the initial struggle, there's a silver lining to ESLint's meticulous scrutiny. The tool not only ensures that my code aligns with established coding standards but also serves as a vigilant companion during the coding process. As someone prone to minor mistakes, such as forgetting to add semicolons, ESLint emerged as a reliable ally. This stood in stark contrast to my experience with a previous IDE, JSFiddle, which often overlooked these subtle yet impactful errors, leading to dysfunctional code.
ESLint's capability to pinpoint errors within the code, accompanied by suggested solutions, was a game-changer. The tool's proficiency in addressing formatting issues, coupled with its insightful recommendations, added a layer of efficiency to my coding journey. It transformed error detection from a tedious task into a constructive learning opportunity.
As I navigate through the semester, I am hopeful that my familiarity with ESLint will evolve, allowing me to strike a harmonious balance between efficient coding and meticulous error correction. The tool, once perceived as a hurdle, now stands as a valuable asset in my coding toolkit. ESLint not only upholds coding standards for future collaboration but also streamlines my coding process by serving as a vigilant guide in the intricate world of programming.

## Takeaways

Recognizing the crucial role of coding standards in the coding journey, I acknowledge the occasional challenge posed by the need to make nuanced adjustments for ESLint compliance. Despite the initial inconvenience, I firmly believe in the necessity of following these standards for creating code of superior quality. My goal is to harness the power of ESLint not only to refine my coding skills but also to gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific rules governing JavaScript. The prospect of uncovering and rectifying coding habits that fall short of these standards adds an element of discovery to this learning process. Embracing this journey, I am determined to fine-tune my coding practices, minimizing instances of red error lines and ultimately contributing to the creation of more robust and standardized code.
